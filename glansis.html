            <h2>overview</h2>
            <p>The GLANSIS website plays a crucial role in fortifying Great Lakes protection by monitoring nonindigenous species. However, its current design lacks accessibility, usability, and modernity, constraining the organization's overall impact. Acknowledging GLANSIS' significance, the redesign focuses on streamlining the Species Generator List for enhanced accessibility, incorporating responsive design for inclusivity. By simplifying navigation and content, the redesign 
                empowers a broader audience to understand GLANSIS' importance in Great Lakes conservation.</p>

        <div class = "problem">
            <h2>01 - the problem</h2>
            <p> The pervasive threat of invasive species in the Great Lakes has led to dire consequences, including the mass endangerment of native species and a 
                substantial decline in local fisheries' revenue. According to NOAA, a staggering 41% of these non-native species are inflicting considerable harm. Despite extensive efforts and expenditures exceeding $200 million on preventative measures and mitigating income losses, the problem persists as a severe and longstanding menace to the region.</p>
            <p>A critical aspect exacerbating this issue is the outdated and inefficient design of the GLANSIS website, specifically the Species List Generator, the primary platform for monitoring nonindigenous species. The current lack of accessibility, usability, and modernity hinders the organization's ability 
                to effectively communicate and engage stakeholders in the fight against invasive species. Addressing this design shortfall is paramount in fortifying GLANSIS' impact and, consequently, the preservation of the Great Lakes ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>02 - the design process</h2>
            <p>This was the first iteration of the mobile application, however, I realized that there were several design factors and usability factors that I hadn't taken into consideration. For example, the mobile application still was text heavy and didn't allow for easy navigation.</p>

            <h2>03 - the final design</h2>
            <p>That leads to my final design iterations for both desktop and mobile. My first iteration only included the mobile prototype, however, from the lessons I learned I applied to both my desktop and mobile final designs. The following edsign choices contributed to improving the users experience when navigating through the GLANSIS site</p>
