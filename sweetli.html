            <h2>overview</h2>
            <p>Established in 2017, I created "Elissa's Sweets" with the purpose of financing philanthropic endeavors aimed at supporting various social justice organizations. The redesign initiative for my website is geared towards providing the Ann Arbor community with seamless access to my baked goods for events and birthdays, while also offering information on a diverse array of charities available for donations. Recognizing the need for improvement, I wanted to refine the outdated aesthetics and layouts of the original website, ultimately prioritizing a more intuitive and refined user experience.</p>

                <h3>goal</h3>
                <p>Redesign the homepage to become more user-friendly and modern. Categorize information to be more easily understood, streamlining the customer experience while incorporating more personality into the design.</p>

            <h2>01 - the problem</h2>
            <p>After establishing my original baking website, I realized that I was getting a lot of comments from customers that they had some trouble navigating the website. A majority of the text on the homepage was unnecessary or placed in areas that made it confusing for customers to order. I highlighted the organizations I donated to, however, the information wasn’t organized properly to emphasize ordering and the history of the company. Also, the site wasn’t formatted modernly, with contrasting white boxes and background colors clashed to be unappealing to the user.</p>
            <p>I wanted to redesign the whole company, not just the website, and eventually relaunch. This new design concept included much more of my Chinese background in not only the menu but the website concept as well. I wanted to incorporate Chinese fusion pastries onto the menu and change the color palette to highlight the classic bright red from Chinese culture. Lastly, I wanted to make my last name, Li, a part of the branding, therefore a transition from “Elissa’s Sweets” to “sweetli”. This redesign would not only require a new menu, but a new website, logo, and overall design. </p>

            <h2>02 - original project</h2>
            <p>This was the first iteration of the website, back in 2017 when I first launched my business. This was a really bare-bone version of the website, with basic functions and limited information on how to order. In hindsight, the website fell incredibly flat. The homepage’s aesthetic was not only old-fashioned, but the colors were distracting and didn’t highlight the important information. Additionally, there wasn’t comprehensive information on how to order, which limited my customer flow. Therefore, when I revisited the concept in 2020 I began to work on a redesign.</p>
            <img src="images/origina_sweetli.png" alt="The original Sweetli homepage site on a desktop view" img id = "original_sweetli_desktop">
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/elissas-sweets/home" class="button">view original site</a>
            <p>The second iteration of the website was much more elegant in design, featuring deeper shades of red and white. This design was much more modernized than the previous one,  however, looking back on this site I realized that the color scheme was still difficult for readers. The combination of dark burgundy and grey backgrounds alternating was distracting, especially because it didn’t section off different parts of information. Furthermore, I wanted to create a more dynamic website, one that could reflect and incorporate my own identity into it. So, I began my third iteration of the website in 2023.</p>
