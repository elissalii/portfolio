            <p>throughout my course in "Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation" at the Univesity of
                 Michigan, I researched to what extent restaurant waste can be harnessed as a sustainable resource to meet the unique needs and operational challenges of food banks and soup kitchens, particularly in alleviating food insecurity in Ann Arbor.</p>

            <h2>01 - the problem</h2>
            <p>Food insecurity has been a generational problem within the United States and primarily affects lower-income and BIPOC communities. Historically, numerous governmental and organizational initiatives have been deployed to tackle food insecurity, influencing programs like food stamps and the 
                establishment of food banks. Ann Arbor, In particular, is home to programs such as Food Gatherers and Maize and Blue Cupboardâ€“vital food banks contributing significantly to mitigating food insecurity by ensuring sustenance for residents throughout the city. </p>
            <p>However, despite these dedicated efforts, individuals and communities grappling with food insecurity continue to face marginalization and neglect within society. Though there are various areas for people to receive food from Food Gatherers, it is difficult to find these locations without 
                previous knowledge, some form of contact who knows where to go, or an internet connection. Furthermore, on a nationwide level, more than 34 million people suffer from food insecurity. More specifically, within Washtenaw County, an alarming 11.6% of the population was projected to suffer from food insecurity. 
                Moreover, the food quality tends to be inconsistent and rarely meets nutritional recommendations. This not only continues to perpetuate poor dietary choices but also increases the likelihood of health complications, particularly hypertension and diabetes, among already vulnerable populations. Furthermore, food banks, a critical resource for those in need are frequently under the constraints of insufficient funding and inadequate staffing.</p>

                <h3>interviewing and affinity diagrams</h3>
                <p>After initiating the beginning of my research and outlining my goals for the process, I conducted five different user interviews from various local food banks and pantries within Ann Arbor and sorted the qualitative data in an affinity diagram.</p>
                <p> I broke down the interviews into a series of themes and codes. The most prominent themes are sorting food donations and organizing food to be displayed.</p>

                <p>Utilizing my data from my interviews and the organization I conducted for my affinity diagram, I then proceeded to curate my task analysis diagram and journey map</p>

                <h3>Usability testing</h3>
                <p>Lastly, I conducted a usability test for "Food Gatherers", the main resource that most local food banks partner with in order to collect most of their donations from. I wanted to examine how efficient
                     the site functioned in order to assess how we could improve it for user experience. I curated a facilitator guide in order to ensure a smooth usability testing experience. During the usability test, I took thorough notes in order to deduce how the user would experience the site.</p>

            <h2>03 - conclusion</h2>
            <h3>key findings</h3>
            <p>This UX case study has delved into the intricate landscape of utilizing restaurant waste to fuel food banks in Ann Arbor, revealing crucial insights that shape the path forward. A key finding emphasizes the paramount importance of food sorting in the process, acting as both the most rigorous step and a significant deterrent for food banks in establishing relationships with restaurants. The challenge lies in ensuring food safety and quality, a hurdle that could be overcome through innovative solutions. Another critical discovery is the absence 
                of a structured program or website hindering the creation of partnerships with restaurants. By addressing this gap, Food Gatherers has an opportunity to revolutionize the landscape by creating an accessible and intuitive food donation page. This platform could also include a feature that facilitates seamless connections with restaurants interested in forming partnerships.</p>
            <h3>recommendations for design</h3>
            <p>To enhance the user experience and foster collaboration, the design should focus on a user-friendly and intuitive food donation page. Implementing clear communication on the benefits of partnerships and showcasing success stories can motivate both restaurants and the community to actively participate. A comprehensive, step-by-step guide on food sorting guidelines should be incorporated into the platform, ensuring that safety standards are met consistently.</p>
            <h3>next steps for further research</h3>
            <p>To refine and expand on the findings, further research should focus on the user experience of both food banks and restaurants. Conducting usability testing on the proposed food donation page can provide valuable insights into user interaction and satisfaction. Additionally, exploring the needs and preferences of potential restaurant partners can inform the development of features that cater specifically to their requirements.</p>
            <h3>lessons learned</h3>
            <p>This research journey underscores the intricate dynamics involved in creating symbiotic relationships between food banks and restaurants. The challenges of food sorting and partnership creation highlight the need for holistic solutions that bridge communication gaps. The importance of continuous feedback loops with all stakeholders should not be underestimated, as it is through their experiences and perspectives that the design can be refined and optimized over time. As the journey continues, the lessons learned here will serve as a foundation for fostering innovative solutions that address the unique challenges in the intersection of restaurant waste and food bank support.</p>
